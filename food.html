        <h5>13th and Alder, Eugene OR</h5>
        <h6>Feb 4th, 2020</h6>
        <p>
          Just a little way down Alder, a few steps North of the Starbucks on 13th, a small Thai restaurant is tucked into the middle of a row of shops.
          Upon stepping into Sweet Basil Express, you’re struck by the strong contrast of fragrant Thai stir-fry dishes and loud Puerto Rican reggaeton, trap, and pop.
          The bustle in the kitchen runs counter to the tranquility of Eugene, and no excess is visible in the decorum.
          But that’s exactly why you go: Sweet Basil delivers exactly what you expect, and they do it every time, with no frills.
          Pad Kee Mao (also commonly known as Drunken Noodle) is one of my favorite dishes.
          It is a harmony of dark soy sauce, fish sauce, rice vinegar, and garlic.
          <br>
          It’s also really commonly done wrong. Many places will use excess soy sauce or fish sauce to compensate for a lack of proper ingredients, drowning the delicate sweetness of the bell peppers and onions in a watery, Umami-laden grave.
          Not Sweet Basil Express though. Every day, Sweet Basil delivers the careful balance of this dish, and they do so for under $10.
          If you’re looking for a bite near campus before 9pm and you’re in the mood for Thai, there’s no better place to go.
