      <h2 style="font-family: 'Vollkorn SC'">Website Update - December 5th, 2017</h2>
      <p>I did a full overhaul of my website today. It's still in the infantile stages, but it's looking better. After about a month of goofing off with some new software, I finally got a song mixed. It's a new one, but I always feel like, after I upload a song to SoundCloud, that I end up noticing a billion little things I wish I'd changed. It's a tad bit annoying, but practice makes perfect. I'm hoping to get at least one more song recorded and uploaded before this semester ends, but there's no guarantees.</p>
